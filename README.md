# Demo using the good-map component with Vaadin Flow

[Introduction to good-map, a simplified version of google-map](https://vaadin.com/blog/introduction-to-good-map-a-simplified-version-of-google-m-1) was the starting point for this project.

It was more an exercise trying to understand Vaadin Flow, Polymer templates, interaction with web components using events and setting properties.

More info on good-map can be found on [https://github.com/keanulee/good-map](https://github.com/keanulee/good-map)

Before running, you will need to provide a valid API key in ExampleMap.html.

Run using `mvn jetty:run` and open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in browser.
